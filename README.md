## Troubleshooting and Maintenance

### Thumbnail Issues Resolution

**Problem**: Photo thumbnails were returning 404 errors, preventing images from displaying properly in the web interface.

**Root Cause**: The database contained photos with broken thumbnail paths (set to `None` or invalid paths like `thumbnails/None.jpg`) due to failed thumbnail generation during photo uploads.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Fixed Thumbnail Generation Logic** (`app/services/photo_service.py`):
   - Improved error handling in thumbnail generation
   - Better logging for debugging thumbnail issues

2. **Created Thumbnail Regeneration Script** (`scripts/regenerate_thumbnails.py`):
   - Automatically finds photos with broken thumbnail paths
   - Fixes invalid paths (like `None.jpg`)
   - Regenerates thumbnails from original files
   - Updates database with correct thumbnail paths

3. **Added Fallback Thumbnail Mechanism** (`app/routes/sites_router.py`):
   - Photos without thumbnails show a placeholder image instead of 404
   - Graceful degradation maintains UI functionality
   - Uses `app/static/img/logo/None_thumb.jpg` as fallback

**Usage**:

To regenerate thumbnails for existing photos with broken paths:

```bash
python scripts/regenerate_thumbnails.py
```

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Thumbnail routes properly implemented
- ✅ Fallback mechanism for missing thumbnails
- ✅ Script available for regenerating existing thumbnails
- ✅ Error handling improved in thumbnail generation

**Database Status** (as of last run):
- 5 photos with broken thumbnail paths identified
- 3 photos with invalid paths (fixed)
- 2 photos with `None` paths (using fallback thumbnails)

## Manual Setup Procedure

You can also set up and manage the project manually using the following steps:

### Creating the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///./users.db"
SECRET_KEY="super-secret-key-example-123456789"

# MinIO Configuration (Required for file uploads)
MINIO_URL="http://localhost:9000"
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin123456789"
MINIO_SECRET_KEY="miniosecret987654321xyz"
MINIO_BUCKET="my-fastapi-bucket"
MINIO_SECURE=false

# CSRF Protection
CSRF_SECRET_KEY="csrf-secret-key-example-987654321"
COOKIE_SAMESITE="lax"
COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

Replace `your_secret_key` with a strong secret key for your application.

**Note:** While using sample MinIO credentials will allow the database to record file uploads, the actual files won't be stored without valid MinIO server credentials. For full file storage functionality, set up a MinIO server or use valid MinIO service credentials.

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-management.git
   cd project-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   If you are using `poetry`, run:

   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

   If you are using `pip`, run:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run database migrations:**

   ```sh
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**

   ```sh
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   ```

5. **Insert Required import in Migration File:**

   After generating the initial migration, open the newly created revision file in app/migrations/versions/ and add the following imports at the top of the file:

   ```sh
   import fastapi_users_db_sqlalchemy.generics
   import app.models.groups
   ```

6. **Apply the changes:**

   ```sh
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

7. **Start the application:**
   If you are using `poetry`, run:

   ```sh
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

   If you are using `uvicorn` directly, run:

   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

8. **Access the application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Updating Model References in `init_models`

When you define a new **Database model** in your application, it's essential to update the `init_models` function to ensure that Alembic can detect and generate migrations for this new model correctly. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your database schema and ensuring that all models are correctly versioned.

### Steps to Update `init_models`

1. **Locate `init_models` Function**: Open the `base.py` file in `app/database/base.py`. This file contains the `init_models` function, which is responsible for importing all the models in your application.

2. **Add New Model Import**: Once you have defined a new model in your application, you need to import it in the `init_models` function. Ensure that you follow the existing import structure. For example, if your new model is `Invoice` and it's located in the `models.financial` module, you would add the following line:

   ```python
   from ..models.financial import Invoice  # noqa: F401
   ```

   The `# noqa: F401` comment at the end of the import statement tells the linter to ignore the "imported but unused" warning, as the import is necessary for Alembic to detect and generate migrations for the model.

3. **Follow Import Conventions**: If you have multiple models in the same module, you can import them in a single line to keep the `init_models` function organized. For example:

   ```python
   from ..models.financial import Invoice, Payment, Transaction  # noqa: F401
   ```

4. **Save Changes**: After adding the import statement for your new model, save the changes to the `base.py` file.

5. **Generate Alembic Migration**: With the new model imported in the `init_models` function, you can now generate an Alembic migration script that includes this model. Run the Alembic command to autogenerate a migration:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added new model Invoice"
   ```

6. **Review and Apply Migration**: Always review the generated migration script to ensure it accurately represents the changes to your models. After reviewing, apply the migration to update your database schema:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
